### Personal Statement

The word "interdisciplinary" might be somewhat overused in the academy today, but neuroscience is a field where its original meaning still holds true. The field has flourished as investigators from disciplines as different as molecular biology, physics, and computer science combined their insights to work on the same fundamental problems. Before deciding to pursue a PhD (and a career) in neuroscience, I spent time exploring a number of other academic disciplines, trying to figure out what specific questions interested me the most. While this has left me with less direct experience with neuroscience at this point than I would have liked, it has also exposed me to a number of different ways of thinking, which I believe will help me as a researcher.

When I arrived at Princeton at the beginning of my freshman year, I didn't know what I wanted to study. This wasn't due to a lack of interest in any of the available majors, but the opposite: I was seriously interested in math, computer science, and philosophy. For my first two years in college, I took classes in all three of these subjects, and satisfied the prerequisites for all three majors. This, however, came at a cost; going into my junior year, my grades weren't what I wanted them to be. Moreover, while I was still enthusiastic about doing research, I still hadn't found a field that I wanted to focus in.

One of the main reasons why I ultimately chose to major in computer science was because of the opportunities the department offered for students to do independent research with faculty in related fields. In the spring of my junior year, I started doing independent research in computational neuroscience with Prof. Jonathan Pillow. This work continued for the rest of my time at Princeton, and culminated in my undergraduate thesis, and a manuscript currently in progress. It would be hard to overstate the effect that this experience had on my academic direction. In computational neuroscience, I found a way to apply my knowledge of probability and computing to questions that I was genuinely curious about. For the first time since coming to Princeton, I had hit my academic stride. Before, I had been very self-conscious of professing intellectual curiosity without having an academic record to show for it. In neuroscience research, I found something I was able to excel at, precisely because I was so curious about it.

After graduating, I took a job as a software engineer at Bloomberg L.P. in New York, because I felt that the industry side of machine learning was worth exploring. Although I did learn a lot about how to build and maintain large software systems, I immediately missed neuroscience and research, so I set out to continue learning about the discipline on my own. I got a membership to NYU's Bobst library, where I would go for hours after work to study. I started methodically, by first getting a broad survey of the field through online courses and introductory textbooks, and then moved on to neural coding and memory, the subfields that most interested me. To study, I read papers on these subjects and coded up the models they described to get a better understanding of them. One of the papers I especially liked was from Prof. Cristina Savin's lab at NYU, on probabilistic interpretations of memory retrieval, so, this May, I reached out to Prof. Savin and was able to join her lab full-time as a research assistant.

Working in Prof. Savin's lab has solidified my desire to contribute to the field of neuroscience and has also showed me how my past experience in other disciplines can help me as a neuroscientist. My background in math, for example, is necessary for working with some of the models that we use to describe neural circuits. Knowledge of multiple programming languages and experience programming in an industrial setting helps me efficiently set up data analyses and numerical simulations. Even my study of philosophy has proved helpful -- in a young field like neuroscience, philosophical questions like what makes two theories equivalent and what constitutes a testable hypothesis are still being sorted out. While I am pursuing my PhD, I hope to use my background in each of these fields to inform my research.
